<h3> Working at Palm Oil Plantation </h3>
<p>My daily life during the MCO is so exciting because i have done a lot of things. For example, I help my parents in handling our palm oil. Eventhough it is during the MCO or not the palm oil must be taken care of before its loses its benefits or its oil. Working at the palm oil is very tiring because I need a lot of energy in order to get the palm oil to fall of from its tree. But not everyday it have its own time when the palm oil have matured enough only then it can be taken care of. It usually takes around 3 to 4 weeks to get it matured enough. It is also based on the fertilizers that we used on it to ensure it grow up with fertility. If the palm oil is not being taken care of it will give a great loss not to us only but for the company or factory also. After taken care of the palm oil it will be send to a factory to extract its oil and the oil will be send to another factory for them to process its to become the things that we used in our daily life such as soaps, wax, and others. I also go work for other people palm oil plantation in order for me to get some pocket money.</p>
<h3> Baking Cake </h3>
<p>During this MCO also I have experienced how to bake a cake properly. With the help from my mother and my sister I managed to make my own version of cake which turn out to be a success. Even I did not expect that I manage to bake my own cake. Baking a cake is so much fun when there is someone with us or with our family and what make its more exciting is when the tastes also did not dissapointed us. MCO makes me learn a lot of new things for me to do when I got a free time instead of hang out with friends.</p>
<h3> Watching Anime </h3>
<p>One of my favourite activity during the MCO is watching anime all day. When I dont have nothing to do I usually spend most of my time watching anime. It does not care if it is an old anime or new anime because everytime I watch it still give me the same feeling the same vibes. That is what I like about watching anime. The feeling never changed whenever how many times we watched it. I usually download the anime from the website and these are the 3 top best website that I always used to download or stream the anime online :</p>
